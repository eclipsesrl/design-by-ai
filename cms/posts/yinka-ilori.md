Everything’s gone virtual these days, from reality to shopping to meetings to trade shows to you-name-it.

And, as it turns out, that includes focus-group testing of packaging and packaging designs.

The Visual Brand Performance Platform from [Vizit](https://vizit.com/), “the world's first Visual Intelligence company,” offers a revolutionary technology that helps global consumer brands drive higher sales by optimizing their visual content and designs. _Packaging Digest_ reported on it in [a February 2021 feature](https://www.packagingdigest.com/package-designers/artificial-intelligence-powers-robust-packaging-design).  The Vizit technology thinks, acts, and learns like a consumer.

“Images are the most effective sales tool on the planet,” said Jehan Hamedi, CEO of Vizit. “To win in our saturated digital visual-centered world, companies need to optimize their visual brand performance and harness the power of their imagery to drive commerce with online consumers.”

In other words, how to get real-world shoppers looking at a digital online shelf to click on your product? Packaging’s role remains the same crucial in this virtual environment, too, though online the only task is to draw and keep shoppers' attention.

Want to know how Walmart, Target, or Amazon shoppers think of your various packaging formats and design options? Want to know how your packaging stacks up against the competition? Vizit can conduct a virtual packaging design assessment for any demographic available and for different online retailers.
