> "Ada, a two-story structure made of 3D printed nodes, fiberglass rods and fabric digitally knit with photoluminescent yarn, uses AI to translate anonymized data about facial expressions, noise, voice tones and language into a choreographed dance of color and light. It's on display on Microsoft's Redmond, Washington, campus."
