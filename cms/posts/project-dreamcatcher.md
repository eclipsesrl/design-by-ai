> "Dreamcatcher is a generative design system that enables designers to craft a definition of their design problem through goals and constraints. This information is used to synthesize alternative design solutions that meet the objectives. Designers are  able to explore trade-offs between many alternative approaches and select design solutions for manufacture."

See the chair designed by Dreamcatcher you can actually buy from Kartell: [www.aidesign.tools/posts/this-chair-is-a-fruit-of-the-collaboration-between-artificial-intelligence-and-human-intelligence](https://www.aidesign.tools/posts/this-chair-is-a-fruit-of-the-collaboration-between-artificial-intelligence-and-human-intelligence)
