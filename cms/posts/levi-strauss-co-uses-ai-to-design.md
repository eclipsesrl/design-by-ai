> To test out his algorithm, Ron decided to design a new Levi’s® Trucker jacket. For inspiration, he leaned on his passion for art history. The classics came to mind: Van Gogh’s Starry Night, David Hockney’s Apple Tree, and Jasper Johns’ Corpse and Mirror II, among 30-plus other references. Using the same algorithm, the program was able to define various parts of the art pieces — like brush strokes, color, and edges — and with a click of a button, the program could replicate thousands of different design options in a matter of seconds.

> With thousands of options to pick from, Ron could narrow down his choices, fine-tune designs and give the process the much-needed creative human influence to perfect the piece. While the ability to create thousands of renderings in a matter of seconds is invaluable, the true beauty of the program is that it can serve up ideas that a designer might not have thought about in the traditional process. This makes AI an especially significant value add for the traditional designer.
