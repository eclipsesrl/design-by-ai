> "At its core, Facet is a vehicle for empowering professional creatives to engage directly with fundamental AI research. Ongoing technical advances in AI are a driving force for higher-level human⇄machine empathy:

*   better computer vision algorithms means
*   → better machine understanding of the world, means
*   → more human⇄machine empathy, means
*   → better creative tools.

> A major factor in our decision to start Facet was the sense that, even if the deep well of progress in computer vision or computer graphics research were to [mysteriously dry up](https://blog.facet.ai/creative-tools-in-the-post-deep-fakes-world/), there were still enough crazy advances in the fundamental technology that were not yet making it into the hands of creative professionals and artists."
