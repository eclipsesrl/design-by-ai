Read about a few fantastic examples of machine generated typefaces: the one on the picture is made by the Viennese [Process Studio:](https://process.studio/works/aifont-ai-generated-typeface/)

> "The AIfont is a system that generates new typefaces. More precisely, it tries to mimic an actual typeface by creating visual output that resembles as one. Our system is using deep learning, a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and a dataset consisting of more than 200 000 different fonts to come up with new ones."

See also a project by Daniel Wenzel – this font is being generated on the fly: it will look differently at every website visit. The typeface changes its shape according to the visitor's location and time of the day! [Explore more here](https://wenzeldaniel.com/shop.php?f=untitledaigan-seed0380)

[Jean Böhm](https://jeanboehm.de/) created a font with StyleGAN: [instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFAHK79hxlW/)

> "This is what a StyleGAN Network is capable of when trained with thousands of fonts!"
