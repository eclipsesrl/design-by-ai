**The ‘Designer’ plugin**

A couple days ago, [a tweet shared by Jordan Singer](https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304) turned the heads of thousands of designers. With the capabilities of GPT-3 (from OpenAI), he shared a sample of what he was able to create: a Figma plugin (called ‘Designer’) that has the ability to generate a functional prototype from raw text. If you haven’t seen it yet, you can view the video of his demo above.

As you can see, what’s written in the described raw text accounts for all the desired functionality and visual/graphical characteristics. Singer keys in:

_“An app that has a navigation bar with a camera icon, “Photos” title, and a message icon, a feed of photos with each photo having a user icon, a photo, a heart icon, and a chat bubble icon”_

Clicks _Design —_ done.

The plugin works its magic and then voila — Everything written in appears as requested. He wanted a photo? He got it. He wanted a ‘heart’ icon? No problem. A feed of photos? Done. AI in this example, was not only able to correctly identify the UI elements to be used in the design, but to also intelligently discern the placement of it on the layout as well. So, without a single line of code (in the conventional sense), we have here a very early look into what’s possible in the years to come, as the technology continues to evolve for UX Design.
