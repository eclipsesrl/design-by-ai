Artificial intelligence (AI) was just an ambiguous term in the realm of digital marketing a few years ago. Today, when AI is delivering exceptional results, marketers no longer feel hesitant to embrace it.

In a [survey](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/02/07/1335563/0/en/Survey-Finds-Machine-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence-are-Top-Business-Priorities.html) commissioned by MemSQL, out of 1600 marketing professionals, 61% of them considered machine learning and artificial intelligence as crucial data initiatives. Another [2018 Salesforce survey](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/best-practices/artificial-intelligence-for-marketing/) revealed that an impressive 84% of marketers have already adopted AI — up from 29% in the preceding year.

This year-after-year growth has surpassed other emerging technologies such as marketing automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) that marketers continue to adopt.

Join us as we take a deeper look into how AI is **revolutionizing the digital marketing game,** as we know it.
