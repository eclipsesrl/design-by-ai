Artificial intelligence found the solution to the original brief. As the designer, Philippe Starck describes: 

> _"Kartell, Autodesk and I asked Artificial Intelligence a question :_

> _‘A.I. how can you support our body with the least amount of material and energy possible?’_

> _A.I., without culture, without memory, without influence, replied simply with intelligence, it’s “artificial” intelligence._

> _A.I. is the first chair designed outside of our brain, outside of our habits of thought._

> _From elsewhere, a new world opens up to us._

> _Unlimited.”_

Generative design is a design exploration technology that allows designers and engineers to input their design goals, along with parameters such as materials, manufacturing methods, and cost constraints. The software then explores all the possible permutations of a solution, quickly generating design alternatives. It tests and learns from each iteration what works and what doesn't.

Looking forward to the tools we user experience designers, graphic designers and others can collaborate with and see apps, posters, experiences designed with AI.
