Anthony Baker talks to us about how these two disciplines can come together and utilise new technological tools like artificial intelligence, language processing and machine learning to deliver better experiences.

Design and the technology used to implement it, have always been two sides of the same coin. How can these two disciplines come together and utilise new technological tools like artificial intelligence, language processing and machine learning to deliver better experiences? Can these technologies help Designers make more informed decisions and mitigate risk?

Different cultures can also impact the challenges Designers and Technologists face. How is the Japanese digital landscape different to the UK and what opportunities does it bring for creativity?

**About our guest**
