The Guardian spoke with Daniel Kahneman over Zoom:

> "I have learned never to make forecasts. Not only can I certainly not do it – I’m not sure it can be done. But one thing that looks very likely is that these huge changes are not going to happen quietly. There is going to be massive disruption. The technology is developing very rapidly, possibly exponentially. But people are linear. When linear people are faced with exponential change, they’re not going to be able to adapt to that very easily. So clearly, something is coming… And clearly AI is going to win \[against human intelligence\]. It’s not even close. How people are going to adjust to this is a fascinating problem – but one for my children and grandchildren, not me."
