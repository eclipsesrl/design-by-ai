Try out the demo to get the real experience

> "A picture worth a thousand words now takes just three or four words to create, thanks to GauGAN2, the latest version of NVIDIA Research’s wildly popular AI painting demo.

> The deep learning model behind [GauGAN](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/03/18/gaugan-photorealistic-landscapes-nvidia-research/) allows anyone to channel their imagination into photorealistic masterpieces — and it’s easier than ever. Simply type a phrase like “sunset at a beach” and AI generates the scene in real time. Add an additional adjective like “sunset at a _rocky_ beach,” or swap “sunset” to “afternoon” or “rainy day” and the model, based on [generative adversarial networks](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2017/06/08/ai-podcast-an-argument-in-a-bar-led-to-the-generative-adversarial-networks-revolutionizing-deep-learning/), instantly modifies the picture."

Launch the interactive demo and see for yourself: [http://gaugan.org/gaugan2](http://gaugan.org/gaugan2) – After running the tutorial it will be relatively easy to generate beautiful landscapes purely by typing in text:
