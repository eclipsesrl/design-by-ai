Nvidia research scientists have developed a tool called GANverse3D - an Nvidia Omniverse extension which can be fed a standard 2D object image, a single photo, and create a realistic 3D model. These full 3D models can then be visualised and controlled in virtual environments in Omniverse. Nvidia reckons this rapid 3D modelling tech could be a boon to architects, creators, game developers and designers. While the 3D models might look a little basic (reminds me of N64 graphics) they can be polished up later by 3D artists if required, after prototyping ideas.
