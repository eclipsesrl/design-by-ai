> "Gavin Miller is the Head of Adobe Research. Adobe have empowered artists, designers, and creative minds from all professions working in the digital medium for over 30 years with software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects, InDesign, Audition that work with images, video, and audio. Adobe Research is working to define the future evolution of these products in a way that makes the life of creatives easier, automates the tedious tasks, and gives more & more time to operate in the idea space instead of pixel space. This is where the cutting-edge deep learning methods of the past decade can shine more than perhaps any other application. Gavin is the embodiment of combing tech and creativity. Outside of Adobe Research, he writes poetry & builds robots."
