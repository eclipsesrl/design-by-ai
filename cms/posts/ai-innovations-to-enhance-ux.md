> "In just half a century, AI’s role in society has become firmly established**.** It has transformed both UI and UX design, breaking down the physical barriers that exist between humans and digital interfaces**.** AI inhabits consumer electronics in the form of Siri, Cortana, Alexa and Google Assistant – these forms of AI remove the need for humans to interact with information ourselves – the AI does that for us**.**

> This can be visualized through science fiction that depicts humans alongside intelligent robots that respond to human commands and environmental cues**.** Instead of manually inputting information into a digital interface , humans navigate digital information through AI**.** Exceptionally intelligent chatbots like the award-winning Mitsuku can equip humans with a ‘partner in UX’ – an AI bot that navigates information on our behalf so we don’t need to navigate it ourselves**.**

> AI’s ability to crunch through calculations enhances UX chiefly by saving time and minimising the number of interactions humans need to have with an interface**.** This enhances UX by circumventing the need for humans to manually calculate and input data themselves – AI takes care of these repetitive tasks, streamlining our user experiences**.**

> The rise of robotic automation and AI has raised legitimate ethical and existential concerns as highlighted by Elon Musk and the late Sir Steven Hawking**.** Immediate concerns tend to revolve around the capacity for automation to strip us of our jobs, replacing various departments within businesses almost wholly**.** By dealing with menial, repetitive tasks such as data input and analysis, AI enables human skill and talent to be directed elsewhere – this emphasizes the most important tenets of UX"
