One hour "quick and dirty" summary of a whole semester.

> This lecture provides an overview over some of the theoretical aspects of AI and architecture. How to define an Artificial Intelligence? How do Neural Networks perceive our world, how do they learn? In this lecture Matias del Campo provides some thoughts on the ontology of Artificial Neural Networks, and their relationship to architectural production. Oscillating between aspects of wicked problems (aesthetics, agency, authorship, inspiration, creativity) and tamed problems (analysis, feature recognition, prediction) this lecture paints a picture as of how architecture might operate in a posthuman design environment.
