Tilesch and Omar Hatamleh: <br>‍</a>"It's the right time for an education reform: for centuries, teachers convey a message in the same way to every single student. In contrast, students intellectual abilities are completely different. As we move toward personalised healthcare, it is time to achieve personalised education as well. It is also important to educate independent, critically thinking adults. We don’t want to teach them how to memorise things, it has no future. If we have a five-year engineering degree by the time the student graduates, most of the things learned will be completely obsolete, precisely because technology is evolving so fast. Bridges of communication should be built between schools and industry so that the curriculum is always kept up to date. <br>In addition, people will need other skills in the future –&nbsp;so they also need people who are good at strategic thinking, emotional intelligence, who are creative, always learn, can change their careers, and are adept at things that are not repetitive. After all, the first jobs that machines will take away from people will be repetitive jobs." – <a href="https://24.hu/tech/2021/05/30/omar-hatamleh-nasa-interju-mesterseg-es-intelligencia-konyv/" target="_blank">source in Hungarian</a>
